        I think remembering my dog's breed is difficult, so it's easier to not have to do that.<sup>Also more ethical</sup>

        A mongrel, mutt or mixed-breed dog is a dog that does not belong to one officially recognized breed and including those that are the result of intentional breeding.

      <br>
      <span>Mongrel dogs can be divided roughly into types:</span>
      <ul class="types">
        <li>Mixes that show characteristics of two or more breeds.</li>
        <li>The generic pariah dog, where non-selective breeding has occurred over many generations. </li>
        <li>Functional breeds, which are purpose-bred dogs selected by their performance at particular tasks.</li>
      </ul>
